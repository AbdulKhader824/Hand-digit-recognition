# Hand-digit-recognition
This project recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset with a feedforward neural network. It preprocesses images by normalizing and flattening them. The Keras model has one hidden layer with 100 neurons (ReLU) and an output layer with 10 neurons (sigmoid). After training for 5 epochs, it achieves over 90% accuracy on the test set.
